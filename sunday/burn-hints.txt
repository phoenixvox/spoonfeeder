Say you have two CocoIOr cartridges (with EEPROM and WizNet)
named D2 and D4.   D4 contains a production Axiom bootrom.
D2 is going to get burned.

Each cartridge has two jumpers (or a jumper and a switch) inside.

To use it for booting, D4 should have the jumpers towards the Ethernet Port
(not towards the edgecard connector).  That is,

  -- D4 uses $FF6[89AB] for wiznet ports
  -- D4 is write-protected

To burn it, D2 should have the jumpers towards the edgecard connector.
That is,

  -- D2 uses $FF7[89AB] for wiznet ports (these will be unused)
  -- D4 is write-enabled

On the mini-MPI, the little switches should be toward the front
of the coco (toward the user).   D4 should be closest to the coco.
D2 should be closest to the power plug.

Boot the Coco with DHCP and connect to the Global Lemma Server.
Go to page 4999.  Launch with @ key.

When it says OK or DONE or something like that, it's done.

NOW remove D4.   Change jumpers on D2 to be like D4.
Put D2 in the driver's seat, next to the coco.
